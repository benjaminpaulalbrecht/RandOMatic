# RandOMatic
An exploration in Randomness and Password Generation 

This project is an exploration and discovery of Randomness, in particular as it relates generating randomness on Computers. 
While many "Random" Number Generators (RNG) only simulate randomness, a true RNG will never create a colliding Value (i.e. never repeat the 
same value, excpet for large occurances, or by "chance")
